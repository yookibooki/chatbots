# Pass Criteria
| criterion | requirement | pass when |
|---|---|---|
| autoscale | grid adapts to viewport | all cards visible at any viewport size, zero scroll h or v, updates live on resize |
| square | cards square | aspect 1:1 (±1px) at all times, incl. immediately after add/remove/resize |
| gap | uniform spacing | every measured gap h and v identical; content/logo never alters spacing |
| logo | contained logos | proportional, fully visible, centered both axes, never sizes card, stays clear of badges |
| badges | chips per card | score top-left, model bottom-right, above logo, zero layout impact |
| dynamic | count-agnostic | add/remove refits with no reload; code has no hardcoded counts/cols |
| coverage | max area use | no column count yields a larger card (small tolerance), grid stays centered |
| ordering | score sort | data-score non-increasing down the list after any edit |
| style | visual baseline | dark theme, rounded cards, glass chips w/ white text, as in current file |
| stack | zero-dep vanilla | single self-contained index.html, no framework/build/CDN, icons/* only external |
